## 1. Introduction {background-color="#003366"}

### Chronic pancreatitis

-   **Pathophysiology:** Recurrent inflammation → fibrosis replaces pancreatic tissue.
-   **Main Consequences:**
    -   **Exocrine and endocrine insufficiency** → malabsorption and diabetes.
    -   **Pain**, driven by neural remodeling, ductal pressure, ischemia, and acute relapses.
-   **Nutritional Impact:**
    -   Malnutrition is common due to pain and functional loss.
    -   **Osteoporosis** and reduced **quality of life** are frequent but often overlooked.
-   **Clinical Approach:**
    -   Nutritional screening and support are critical in multimodal management.
-   **Guidelines:**
    -   Despite recent AP and CP guidelines, no prior consensus existed on nutrition.

### Recomendation 20:

**Risk of malnutrition in chronic pancreatitis is high and malnutrition is common in patients with chronic pancreatitis.**

**(S2, strong consensus, 100 %)**

**Commentary**

Malnutrition is often a late, but important manifestation in the course of CP and depends on the intensity and duration of the underlying disease. The latency between onset of first symptoms and signs of CP, including pain and malabsorption/malnutrition is between five to ten years in alcoholic, but delayed in non-alcoholic pancreatitis \[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4),[85](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib85)\].

Despite the inconsistency of the data there is an evident risk of malnutrition in patients with CP \[[\[86\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib86), [\[87\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib87), [\[88\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib88)\]. According to a recent study medium or higher risk for malnutrition based on Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) score of one or higher was found in 31.5 % patients \[[89](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib89)\]. Similarly, 26 % underweight patients with a nutritional risk were identified in a study of outpatients with CP \[[90](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib90)\].

In patients with CP with moderate to severe weight loss, decreased [lean body mass](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/lean-body-weight) and [sarcopenia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/sarcopenia) may lead to decreased functional capacity, which may have an impact on [quality of life](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/quality-of-life) \[[\[91\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib91), [\[92\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib92), [\[93\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib93)\]. In addition, [PEI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency) leads to the increased risk of developing significant [bone loss](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/osteolysis) and severe [osteoporosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/osteoporosis) \[[94](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib94),[95](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib95)\]. A recent prospective study \[[93](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib93)\] including 182 patients with CP showed that sarcopenia was present in 17 % (74 % of patients with CP had a [BMI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/body-mass-index) \>18.5 kg/m^2^). During follow-up, sarcopenia was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (OR 2.2; 95 % CI 0.9 to 5.0; p = 0.07), increased number of in-hospital days (p \< 0.001), and reduced survival (HR 6.7; 95 % CI 1.8 to 25.0; p = 0.005).

### Recomendation 21: Pancreatic insufficiency

[**Pancreatic insufficiency**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pancreatic-insufficiency)**, abdominal pain, alcohol abuse, lower food intake, diabetes mellitus and smoking are the main causes of malnutrition in chronic pancreatitis.**

**(S3, strong consensus, 97 %)**

**Commentary**

Multiple risk factors for developing [nutrient deficiencies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nutritional-deficiency) and malnutrition co-exist in patients with CP. First of all, pancreatic insufficiency (exocrine but also often endocrine) can lead to [maldigestion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/functional-gastrointestinal-disorder) and [malabsorption](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/malabsorption). Clinical signs of PEI include [steatorrhea](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/steatorrhea), abdominal pain, weight loss and malnutrition \[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4)\]. Recent data showed endocrine insufficiency and/or clinical steatorrhea in 41 % and 36 % of 809 patients \[[96](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib96)\]. Moreover, increased [resting energy expenditure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/resting-energy-expenditure) can be seen in up to 50 % of patients with CP, thus leading to a negative energy balance and malnutrition \[[97](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib97)\]. Furthermore, abdominal pain, which is frequent in patients with CP, can lead to suboptimal dietary intake and also contribute to malnutrition \[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4)\].

Tobacco is an independent risk factor for CP, and can also be a disease modifier, acting in synergy with alcohol intake, and therefore, adds to the nutritional risk factors \[[96](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib96)\].

### 4.1. Diagnostics

### 4.1.1. Evaluation of nutritional status and screening for micro- and macronutrient deficiencies ([Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#fig6))

-   22\) Nutritional status should be assessed according to symptoms, organic functions, [anthropometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/anthropometry), and biochemical values. Solely body mass index should not be used, because it does not register sarcopenia in the obese patient with chronic pancreatitis.

**(R19, grade GPP, strong consensus, 97 %)**

**Commentary**

Studies assessing malnutrition have identified many biochemical factors that are associated with malnutrition \[[98](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib98),[99](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib99)\] and prevalence studies show a diverse presentation of malnutrition. Olesen et al. identified that 26 % of patients with CP were underweight in a cross-sectional study of 166 patients with CP \[[90](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib90)\], whereas Duggan et al. highlighted that over half of the patients in their prospective controlled [cohort study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cohort-analysis) (n = 128) fell into the overweight/obese category using BMI \[[91](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib91)\]. However, patients had lower muscle stores and reduced functional status assessed using hand-grip strength than healthy controls. Consequently, BMI alone is not considered an adequate method of assessing nutritional status. Percentage weight loss is considered a more reliable indicator of the onset of malnutrition and is associated with an increased risk in the surgical setting \[[100](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib100)\].

Consequently, [nutritional assessment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nutritional-assessment) should allow for detection of simple malnutrition, sarcopenia and micronutrient deficiencies in addition to identifying symptoms that may predispose patients to worsening malnutrition.

-   23\) **Patients should undergo screening for micro- and macronutrient deficiencies at least every twelve months; screening may need to occur more frequently in those with severe disease or uncontrolled malabsorption.**

**(R20, grade GPP, strong consensus, 100 %)**

**Commentary**

Patients with CP are at high risk of malnutrition, both in terms of body weight and altered body composition \[[91](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib91)\]. This has an impact on quality of life \[[90](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib90)\] and survival after surgery \[[101](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib101),[102](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib102)\]. Nutritional intervention can improve nutritional markers and is associated with reduced pain \[[103](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib103)\] and, therefore, routine screening to trigger nutritional intervention should be undertaken. Deficiencies in micronutrients (vitamin B12, [folic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/folic-acid), [vitamin A](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/retinol), D and E, zinc, selenium, iron) are well documented in patients with PEI, these are diverse in presentation with some studies reporting biochemical deficiencies \[[91](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib91),[94](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib94),[104](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib104)\] and case reports document clinical manifestations including [night blindness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nyctalopia)\[[105](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib105),[106](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib106)\]. However, there are no data recommending the frequency of assessment or the likely timing of progression to micronutrient deficiency. As clinical manifestation of deficiency represents a late presentation, routine screening should be implemented to detect early signs of deficiency.

### 4.1.2. Check for exocrine insufficency and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy ([Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#fig7))

-   24\) When pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is diagnosed through clinical signs and symptoms and/or laboratory tests of malabsorption, [pancreatic enzyme](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pancreas-enzyme)replacement therapy shall be initiated. An accurate nutritional assessment is mandatory to detect signs of malabsorption.

**(R34, grade A, strong consensus, 100 %)**

**Commentary**

The most frequent clinical sign of PEI is steatorrhea \[[107](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib107)\], defined as presence of fat in the stool, and associated generally with [flatulence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/flatulence), bloating, dyspepsia, urgency to pass stools, and cramping abdominal pain. In a recent [systematic review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/systematic-review), including 14 studies on pancreatic [enzyme supplementation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/enzyme-supplementation) in patients with CP, the criteria for the diagnosis of PEI were the measurement of the coefficient of [fat absorption](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/lipid-absorption) with a threshold \<80 % or the [fecal fat](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/feces-lipid) absorption less than 7–15 g of fat per day \[[108](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib108)\].

PEI is consistently associated with biochemical and clinical signs of malnutrition Management of PEI involves replacing the inadequate pancreatic enzymes, which should be used to maintain weight and improve the symptoms of maldigestion \[[109](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib109),[110](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib110)\].

Awareness of PEI among many physicians is poor outside of referral centers and especially among physicians in [primary care](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/primary-health-care) \[[111](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib111),[112](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib112)\]. Nevertheless, untreated PEI has also a deleterious impact on the quality of life of patients \[[113](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib113)\]. It is recommended that enzyme replacement is started when clinical signs of malabsorption, or anthropometric and/or biochemical signs of malnutrition are present \[[87](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib87),[\[114\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib114), [\[115\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib115), [\[116\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib116), [\[117\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib117)\]. Symptoms include weight loss, alteration of body compartments at bioimpedance analysis, and low nutritional markers (albumin, [cholinesterase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cholinesterase), [prealbumin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/transthyretin), retinol-binding protein, and magnesium) \[[114](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib114),[\[118\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib118), [\[119\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib119), [\[120\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib120), [\[121\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib121)\].

-   25\) pH-sensitive, enteric-coated [microspheres](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/microsphere) pancreatic enzyme replacement preparations shall be used for treating pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.

**(R35, grade A, strong consensus, 100 %)**

**Commentary**

Several factors affect the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme supplementation: (i) mixture with meal; (ii) gastric emptying with meal; (iii) mixing with chyme and [bile acids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bile-acid) and rapid release of enzymes in [duodenum](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/duodenum) \[[122](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib122)\].

Nowadays, most of the pancreatic [enzyme preparations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/enzyme-preparation) are formulated as pH-sensitive, enteric-coated, capsules containing microspheres or tablets that protect the enzymes from gastric acidity and allow them to disintegrate rapidly at pH \> 5.5 in the duodenum \[[\[122\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib122), [\[123\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib123), [\[124\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib124)\].

The efficacy of these more recent formulations has been demonstrated in several recent studies \[[\[125\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib125), [\[126\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib126), [\[127\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib127), [\[128\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib128)\] and in a recent meta-analysis \[[108](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib108)\]. A Cochrane review on the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme preparations in patients with pancreatic insufficiency demonstrated a higher efficacy for enteric-coated microspheres compared with enteric-coated tablets \[[129](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib129)\]. Mini-microspheres 1.0–1.2 mm in diameter seem to be associated with higher therapeutic efficacy compared with 1.8–2.0 mm microspheres that still have an optimal therapeutic action \[[130](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib130)\]. Another trial compared two enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme preparations. One moisture-resistant, formulated to contain between 90 % and 110 % labeled [lipase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/triacylglycerol-lipase) content over the shelf life of the product and the other potentially unstable in the presence of moisture and degradable over time. The characteristics of the moisture-resistant formulation should have allowed more accurate dosing, both providing more predictable therapeutic effects and reducing the risk of overdose, which is assumed as a potential risk factor for fibrosing [colonopathy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/colon-disease). The results suggested a comparable efficacy and safety in patients with cystic fibrosis for the treatment of PEI \[[131](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib131)\].

-   26\) **Oral pancreatic enzymes should be distributed along with meals and snacks.**

**(R36, grade B, strong consensus, 100 %)**

**Commentary**

The efficacy of pancreatic enzyme supplements presupposes the mixing of enzymes and chyme \[[123](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib123)\]. While one study evaluating the impact of the scheduling of pancreatic [enzyme replacement therapy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/enzyme-replacement-therapy) (PERT) administration on fat malabsorption suggested the optimal timing of administration was during or after meals, no significant difference was observed when patients took PERT immediately before meals \[[132](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib132)\]. In practice, although many patients prefer to take PERT at the beginning of meals, they should be encouraged to spread the capsules out over a meal when using multiple capsules or with larger meals \[[124](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib124),[132](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib132)\]. If the patient is taking the older preparations of [pancreas powder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pancreas-extract), they should take about a third of the dose immediately before, one third during, and one third immediately after the meal. This concerns only meals and snacks that contain fat (e.g. not for fruit).

-   27\) **The posology aims at individual needs and depends on the severity of the disease and the composition of the meal. In practice, a minimum lipase dose of 20,000**–**50,000 PhU (based on the preparation) shall be taken together with main meals, and half that dose with snacks.**

**(R37, grade A, strong consensus, 100 %)**

**Commentary**

The [dosage recommended](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/recommended-drug-dose) depends on the patient's clinical response, but the dosage and dosing will need to be monitored carefully, as well as altered, depending on patient's food intake/pattern of eating, method of cooking, portion sizes, and disease evolution.

For the digestion of a normal meal a minimum activity of 30,000 IU of naturally secreted pancreatic lipase is required. The recommended initial dose is about 10 % of the physiologically secreted dose of lipase after a normal meal \[[133](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib133)\]. Since 1 IU of naturally secreted lipase equals 3 PhU in commercial preparations, the minimum amount of lipase needed for digestion of a normal meal is 90,000 PhU (endogenous plus orally administered lipase).

The results of several [RCTs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/randomized-controlled-trial) have proven the efficacy of PERT with enteric-coated mini-microspheres at a dose ranging from 40,000–80,000 PhU of lipase per main meal, and half dose per snack \[[127](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib127),[128](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib128),[132](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib132),[\[134\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib134), [\[135\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib135), [\[136\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib136)\]. Studies evaluating enteric-coated microspheres have shown a similar efficacy for doses ranging from 10,000–40,000 PhU of lipase per meal, indicating the lack of a dose-response relationship with these preparations \[[137](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib137),[138](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib138)\].

In patients with exocrine failure, who do not improve with semi-elemental formulae, pancreatic enzymes can be administered with the formula \[[140](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib140)\]. This involves opening the capsules and suspending the enzyme microspheres in thickened acidic fluid (such as the mildly thickened or “nectar-thick” fruit juice used for dysphagia) for delivery via the feeding tube.

**Commentary**

The aforementioned recent meta-analysis including 14 RCTs \[[108](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib108)\] showed that PERT increased the coefficient of fat absorption, as well as improved gastrointestinal symptoms, compared with baseline or placebo. Two open label extensions up to one year from RCTs included in the meta-analysis demonstrated significant improvement in nutritional parameters and weight \[[126](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib126),[141](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib141)\]. A review of reported data \[[98](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib98)\] as well as the recent guidelines on the therapy for CP \[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4)\] support the use of nutritional parameters as an optimal way to assess the efficacy of PERT. Dietary intake and nutritional status should be monitored regularly to maximize patient compliance and specialist dietetic assessment sought in patients with underlying malnutrition \[[142](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib142)\].

In patients who do not respond, pancreatic function tests \[[108](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib108)\] while on PERT can monitor effectiveness. ^13^C-MTG-breath test is a useful method that can replace the somewhat cumbersome fecal fat excretion tests and can be used for patients on PERT \[[143](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib143)\].

-   30\) In case of unsatisfactory clinical response, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy dosage should be increased or a protein pump inhibitor should be added. If these methods fail, other causes of malabsorption such as small intestinal [bacterial overgrowth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bacterial-overgrowth) should be excluded.

**Commentary**

The recommended dose of 20,000–50,000 PhU with main meals has been shown to improve symptoms in more than half the patients \[[108](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib108)\]. Dose escalation may be warranted according to response. In adults there is no upper limit to dosing, as there is no risk of overdose because pancreatic enzymes exceeding the needs are eliminated in the stool. Caution for high PERT dosage should be exercised in children, in whom colonic strictures have been described after high dose of the enteric coated, delayed release preparations \[[139](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib139)\].

Nevertheless, a review including 34 [clinical trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/clinical-trial) failed to show improvement in the efficacy of PERT with PPI or histamine-2 receptor antagonists \[[145](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib145)\]. It is noteworthy that the populations included and the therapeutic schemes were very heterogeneous, therefore, suggesting significant bias.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can also explain persistent symptoms.

Common indications for surgical intervention in CP include poorly controlled pain, duodenal, biliary and [pancreatic duct obstruction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pancreas-duct-stenosis), and suspicion of cancer \[[147](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib147)\].

Surgery for CP can be broadly classified into three categories: [drainage procedures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/drainage-procedure), partial pancreatic resection including or not the duodenum, and [total pancreatectomy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pancreatectomy).

Theoretically, the type of procedure may deeply affect short- and long-term nutritional outcomes, since the extension of the parenchyma resection, as well as the preservation of the duodenum and bile natural transit, and [pancreatic secretion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pancreas-secretion) may represent key factors for endocrine and exocrine functions \[[148](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib148),[149](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib149)\].

Fig. 8. Diagnosis and management of bone diseases. CP, chronic pancreatitis; DXA, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.

**Commentary**

A systematic review and meta-analysis including ten studies revealed, of the total 513 patients with CP included, a pooled prevalence rate of osteoporosis of 24.3 % (95 % CI 16.6–32.0 %) and osteopathy (either osteoporosis or osteopenia) of 65 % (95 % CI 54.7–74.0 %) \[[155](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib155)\]. Two of the included studies revealed osteoporosis rate for controls respectively 8.6 and 10.2 %. Data suggest that [vitamin D](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vitamin-d) deficiency is not the sole driver of [bone demineralization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bone-decalcification), other factors that may be of importance for premature bone demineralization in CP are heavy smoking, low physical activity, and [chronic inflammation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/chronic-inflammation) \[[156](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib156)\].

The important [clinical endpoint](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/clinical-endpoint) of osteoporosis is bone fracture. Two large retrospective studies shed light on this regarding patients with CP. The first is a cohort database study, examining patients with CP at a single tertiary care center. A total of 3192 patients with CP and 1,436,699 controls were included in the study. The fracture prevalence (patients with fracture per total patients) was 1.1 % in controls (16,208/1,436,699) and 4.8 % in patients with CP (154/3192); in comparison [Crohn's disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/crohns-disease) revealed a risk of 3.0 % (182/6057); [liver cirrhosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/liver-cirrhosis) 4.8 % (805/16,658) and celiac disease 5.0 % (74/1480) \[[157](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib157)\].

The second, a Danish [retrospective cohort study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/retrospective-cohort-study) including 2594 patients with CP revealed an adjusted hazard ratio for any fracture of 1.7 (95 % CI 1.6 to 1.8) \[[158](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib158)\]. Patients with CP receiving PERT for fat malabsorption had a lower risk of fractures than other CP patients (HR 0.8; 95 % CI 0.7 to 0.9).

-   33\) **Basic preventive measures should be advised to all patients with chronic pancreatitis including adequate calcium/vitamin D intake and, if indicated, pancreatic enzyme supplementation, regular weight-bearing exercise and smoking and alcohol avoidance. Additional pharmacologic treatment should be reserved for patients with osteopathy and, in particular, osteoporosis.**

**(R42, grade GPP, strong consensus, 97 %)**

**Commentary**

The reasons for osteopathy in CP are multifactorial; (i) low serum vitamin D concentrations due to impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, poor dietary intake (including calcium) and/or sunshine exposure, (ii) smoking and alcohol intake, (iii) low physical activity, and (iv) chronic inflammation, all contribute. Therefore, basic preventive measures should be advised to all patients with CP including adequate calcium/vitamin D intake and PERT if indicated, regular weight-bearing exercise and avoidance of smoking and alcohol \[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4)\]. Research on pharmaceutical supplementation of vitamin D and calcium in patients with [osteopenia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/osteopenia) and adding [bisphosphonates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bisphosphonate) in osteoporosis has mainly been performed in post-menopausal women and elderly patients. Based on these findings, and bearing in mind that the cost and side effects are limited, one could consider in patients with osteopathy to supplement vitamin D (800 IU) and calcium (500–1000 mg) daily \[[110](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib110)\]. In patients with osteopenia it is recommended to repeat the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) every two years, whereby in patients with osteoporosis there are no specific recommendations beside appropriate medication, screening for other causes and/or referral to a bone specialist \[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4)\].

**Commentary**

The American College of [Radiology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/radiology) aims to rate the appropriateness of several radiological modalities for specific patient populations. Although they do not mention CP explicitly, they do state that in [premenopausal females](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/premenopause) and males 20–50 years of age with malabsorption, DXA of the [lumbar spine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/lumbar-spine) and hip(s) or distal forearm is usually an appropriate diagnostic modality to identify low bone mineral density \[[159](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib159)\]. It is not yet well defined when and to whom these tests should be offered in patients with CP. However, there are recommendations from the American Gastroenterological Association on the detection of osteoporosis in other [gastrointestinal diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gastrointestinal-disease): recommending that patients with at least one additional osteoporosis risk factor should undergo initial screening with DXA \[[160](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib160)\]. This recommendation was specifically for [inflammatory bowel disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/inflammatory-bowel-disease), celiac disease, and post-gastrectomy patients. The recently published HaPanEU guidelines on CP argued that bone density testing by DXA should be extended to patients with CP with an additional risk; post-menopausal women, those with previous low-trauma fractures, men over 50 years and those with malabsorption \[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4)\]. They further stated that considering the associated morbidity and cost of bone fractures when prevention is within range \[[161](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib161)\], a baseline bone density assessment for all patients with CP may be worth considering.

**Commentary**

There are very little data to suggest the optimal dietary management for patients with CP. Historically, patients were encouraged to have a low-fat diet, and studies in the Netherlands suggest 48–58 % of patients still restrict [dietary fat](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fat-intake) \[[95](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib95),[111](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib111)\].

The role of dietary fat has been examined in small studies, suggesting an improvement in dyspeptic symptoms in patients with very mild [pancreatic disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pancreas-disease) who did not consume alcohol regularly when a very low fat diet was consumed (\<20 g fat per day) \[[166](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib166)\] and patients who consumed a [higher fat diet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/lipid-diet) were thought to be diagnosed at a younger age, and had an increased probability of continuous abdominal pain \[[167](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib167)\] suggesting a potential role in the initial development of CP. However once CP was diagnosed, there was no difference in severity or complications of disease. An RCT comparing dietary counselling and [nutritional supplements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nutrition-supplement) in a cohort of 60 malnourished patients with CP found that nutritional intervention in which 33 % of energy was derived from fat was well tolerated \[[103](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib103)\].

In a prospective controlled cohort study of 128 subjects and 66 age/gender-matched controls, 14.5 % and 24.2 % were deficient in vitamins A and E, respectively, with a significant difference compared with controls. Nineteen percent of patients had excess serum vitamin A concentrations \[[91](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib91)\]. This must be taken in account and a blind supplementation of all fat-soluble vitamins for all patients with CPs is not advised.

Deficiencies of water-soluble vitamins in patients with CP are less frequent. A recent study with 301 patients with CP and 266 controls showed that patients with CP had significantly lower concentrations of vitamins A, D and E, but no difference regarding [vitamin B12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cyanocobalamin) \[[94](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib94)\]. Similarly, another cohort study of 114 patients with CP (33 % with exocrine failure) did not show any significant deficiencies of vitamin B12 (0 %) and folic acid (2.2 %) \[[114](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib114)\].

ONS can be of benefit in undernourished patients with CP, especially if the caloric and protein goals cannot be reached with normal meals and counselling. ONS are a simple way to improve oral intake, but long-term compliance may be a problem.

-   42\) If adequate enzyme supplementation and exclusion of bacterial overgrowth has not led to relief of malabsorption and its accompanying symptoms, oral nutritional supplements with [medium chain triglycerides](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/medium-chain-triacylglycerol) can be administered.

**(R25, grade 0, strong consensus, 97 %)**

**Commentary**

There are no RCTs investigating the relative efficacy of different formulae (e.g. standard or peptide-based with medium chain triglycerides (MCT)). However, in the presence of PEI, enteral formulae consisting of pre-digested products and a mixture of [long chain fatty acids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/long-chain-fatty-acid) and MCT would seem, theoretically, to have potential advantage. MCTs are less dependent on lipase activity for their absorption \[[171](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib171)\]. A reduction in oral fat intake or the replacement of dietary fat with MCT risks a reduction in [energy intake](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/caloric-intake) and, therefore, a negative energy balance. MCTs have an unpleasant taste and are associated with adverse effects like cramps, nausea, and diarrhea. Up to now, studies have not shown any clear benefit of MCTs over standard long-chain triglycerides when used in combination with enzyme supplementation \[[171](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib171),[172](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib172)\]. One RCT investigated the efficacy of ONS in patients with CP and severe malnutrition \[[103](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib103)\]. Dietary counselling achieved equal results compared with the use of a commercial supplement enriched with MCTs. Both groups also received enzyme supplementation and so it is not possible to explain the additional gain from dietary MCTs over enzyme supplementation.

Fig. 10. Management of malnourished patients with chronic pancreatitis in whom oral nutrition is insufficient. CP, chronic pancreatitis; EN, enteral nutrition; MCT, medium chain triglycerides; PN, parenteral nutrition.

**Commentary**

Oral nutritional support with dietary counselling is usually sufficient to improve nutritional status in patients with CP \[[105](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib105)\]. EN is indicated in approximately 5 % of patients with CP \[[90](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib90)\]. Regarding indications and outcomes of EN in these patients, evidence is based on few cohort studies and RCTs are generally lacking \[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4)\].

-   44\) Enteral nutrition should be administered via the nasojejunal route in patients with pain, [delayed gastric emptying](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/stomach-paresis), persistent nausea or vomiting and gastric outlet syndrome.

**(R28, grade GPP, strong consensus, 100 %)**

**Commentary**

Four retrospective series have shown the benefits of EN in patients with CP regarding weight gain and pain control \[[\[173\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib173), [\[174\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib174), [\[175\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib175), [\[176\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib176)\]. Two of them included 58 \[[174](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib174)\] and 50 patients \[[176](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib176)\] respectively, in whom a naso-jejunal tube was placed.

-   45\) **Semi-elemental formulae with medium chain triglycerides can be used if standard formulae are not tolerated.**

**(R30, grade GPP, strong consensus, 94 %)**

**Commentary**

There is limited high quality evidence for the composition of enteral formulae in patients with CP. However, there is a rationale that semi-elemental enteral formulae with MCTs are more adapted for jejunal nutrition, compared with polymeric formulae \[[177](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib177)\]. In two of the aforementioned studies \[[174](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib174),[176](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib176)\], semi-elemental formulae were used with good digestive tolerance. Nevertheless, the cost of these feeds is higher and data on cost-effectiveness are also lacking.

-   46\) Long-term [jejunostomy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/jejunostomy) access (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension or direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy or surgical jejunostomy) can be used in those requiring EN for more than 30 days.

**(R29, grade GPP, strong consensus, 97 %)**

**Commentary**

Long-term access with a [percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy) with jejunal extension or a direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy was used in 57 \[[173](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib173)\] and 58 patients \[[175](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib175)\]. All studies showed that this type of nutritional support was safe and effective in patients with CP, even in case of gastric outlet syndrome \[[175](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib175),[176](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib176)\].

### 4.2.4. Parenteral nutrition ([Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#fig10))

-   47\) Parenteral nutrition may be indicated in patients with [gastric outlet obstruction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pylorus-stenosis) and in those with complex fistulating disease, or in case of intolerance of enteral nutrition.

**(R32, grade GPP, strong consensus, 100 %)**

**Commentary**

PN is infrequently uses in patients with CP \[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4),[88](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib88)\]. EN preserves immune function and mucosal architecture and decreases the possibility for [hyperglycemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hyperglycemia) while PN also increases the risk of catheter-related infections and septic complications \[[87](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib87),[165](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib165)\]. PN is, therefore, only indicated when it is impossible to use EN (e.g. presence of gastric outlet obstruction, the need for gastric decompression, when it is impossible to introduce a tube into the [jejunum](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/jejunum), or a complicated [fistula](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fistula) is present) or if requirements are only partly reached by EN.

-   48\) **For parenteral nutrition the preferable route is central venous access.**

**(R33, grade GPP, strong consensus, 100 %)**

**Commentary**

PN is mainly administered over a short-term period and long-term studies are lacking. In this case, a standard nutritional solution should be administered via central venous access such as a [peripherally inserted central catheter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/peripherally-inserted-central-catheter). Contraindications to PN do not differ from general contraindications to medical nutrition.
