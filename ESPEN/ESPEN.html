<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the most common acute <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gastrointestinal-disease" title="Learn more about gastrointestinal disease from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">gastrointestinal disease</a> requiring hospital admission [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib1">1</a>], with the outcome being favorable in most cases (80 %) [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib2">2</a>]. However, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acute-hemorrhagic-pancreatitis" title="Learn more about acute necrotizing pancreatitis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">acute necrotizing pancreatitis</a> (ANP) may develop in up to 20 % of patients and is associated with significant rates of early organ failure (38 %), need for intervention (38 %), and death (15 %) [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib2">2</a>]. Catabolism is very high in this setting; therefore, nutritional support is one of the cornerstones of management [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib3">3</a>]. A significant amount of research has shown the superiority of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/enteric-feeding" title="Learn more about enteral nutrition from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">enteral nutrition</a> (EN) over <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/parenteral-nutrition" title="Learn more about parenteral nutrition from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">parenteral nutrition</a> (PN) in ANP, creating a paradigm shift a decade ago and modifying the management strategy [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib3">3</a>]. Nevertheless, additional questions regarding the timing, route and type of EN, as well as the place of oral refeeding, are still the objects of clinical investigations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/chronic-pancreatitis" title="Learn more about Chronic pancreatitis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">Chronic pancreatitis</a> (CP) is a disease in which recurrent inflammatory episodes lead to replacement of the pancreatic parenchyma by fibrous connective tissue [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4">4</a>]. The major consequence of CP is the loss of functional exocrine and endocrine pancreatic tissue, thus resulting in both exocrine and endocrine insufficiency [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4">4</a>]. Pain is also frequently encountered in patients with CP, and seems to be related to a multitude of factors such as pancreatic neural remodeling and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neuropathy" title="Learn more about neuropathy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">neuropathy</a>, increased intraductal and parenchymal pressure, pancreatic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ischemia" title="Learn more about ischemia from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">ischemia</a> and acute inflammation during an acute relapse [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib5">5</a>]. Both pain and loss of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pancreas-function" title="Learn more about pancreatic function from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">pancreatic function</a> can lead to malnutrition in patients with CP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4">4</a>]. Moreover, other long-term consequences such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/osteoporosis" title="Learn more about osteoporosis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">osteoporosis</a> are frequently overlooked, despite their potential impact on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/quality-of-life" title="Learn more about quality of life from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">quality of life</a> in patients with CP. Therefore, screening for malnutrition and nutritional support play a crucial part in the multimodal management required in this setting.</p>
<p>Although recent guidelines for AP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib2">2</a>] and CP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4">4</a>] have been published, a dedicated consensus on nutritional support in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pancreas-disease" title="Learn more about pancreatic diseases from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">pancreatic diseases</a> is lacking. The recently published guideline from European Society for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/clinical-nutrition" title="Learn more about Clinical Nutrition from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">Clinical Nutrition</a> and Metabolism (ESPEN) provided specific recommendations focused on clinical nutrition for patients with acute or chronic pancreatitis to fulfill the gap [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib6">6</a>].</p>
</section>
<section id="methodology" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology">2. Methodology</h2>
<p>The present practical guideline consists of 42 recommendations and six statements and is based on the aforementioned ESPEN guideline on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/clinical-nutrition" title="Learn more about clinical nutrition from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">clinical nutrition</a> in acute and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/chronic-pancreatitis" title="Learn more about chronic pancreatitis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">chronic pancreatitis</a> [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib6">6</a>]. The original guideline was shortened by focusing the commentaries on the evidence and literature on which the recommendations are based on. The recommendations were not changed, but the presentation of the content was transformed into a graphical presentation. The original guideline was developed according to the standard operating procedure for ESPEN guidelines and consensus papers [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib7">7</a>].</p>
<p>A comprehensive, systematic literature search was performed on 1st December 2018, based on 31 clinical questions in PICO (population of interest, interventions, comparisons, outcomes) format. Existing evidence was graded according to the SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) grading system. Recommendations were developed and graded into four classes (A/B/0/GPP) [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib7">7</a>].</p>
<p>All recommendations were agreed in a multistage consensus process, which resulted in a percentage of agreement (%). The guideline process was funded exclusively by the ESPEN society. For further details on methodology, see the full version of the ESPEN guideline [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib6">6</a>] and the ESPEN standard operating procedure [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib7">7</a>].</p>

<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, the majority of patients with AP have predicted mild or moderately severe forms of the disease that are self-limited with fully recovery in less than a week, in whom oral feeding can be started within few days after the onset of AP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib8">8</a>]. Gut-barrier dysfunction may occur in up to 60 % of patients with AP; mostly in severe AP and it is thought to lead to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bacterial-translocation" title="Learn more about bacterial translocation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">bacterial translocation</a> and infection of necrosis [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib9">9</a>]. Along with the increased catabolic state related to the disease, patients with predicted severe AP are considered at nutritional risk [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib10">10</a>]. Nevertheless, malnourished patients should also be considered at nutritional risk, even if they have predicted mild AP, because of their pre-existing condition. Similarly, patients with increased alcohol consumption are frequently malnourished [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib11">11</a>].</p>

<p>Scoring systems such as the NRS 2002 [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib12">12</a>], can be helpful in identifying these patients [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib13">[13]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib14">[14]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib15">[15]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib16">[16]</a>]. These scores have been validated in hospitalized, as well as critically ill patients. Nevertheless, no studies have validated these scoring systems in a specific population of patients with AP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib17">17</a>].</p>
<p>A low <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/body-mass-index" title="Learn more about body mass index from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">body mass index</a> (BMI) may also identify patients who are at nutritional risk. Nevertheless, obesity is a known risk factor for severe AP and is, therefore, a disease severity-related nutritional risk [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib18">18</a>].</p>

The meta-analysis by Al-Omran et al.&nbsp;was performed to Cochrane-standards on the basis of eight RCTs with 348 patients and clearly shows that early EN when compared with initial <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/total-parenteral-nutrition" title="Learn more about total PN from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">total PN</a>, significantly decreases mortality by 50 % (OR 0.50 [95 % CI 0.28 to 0.91]), rate of infection (OR 0.39 [95 % CI 0.23 to 0.65]), multi-organ failure (0.55 [95 % CI 0.37 to 0.81]) as well as the necessity for operation (OR 0.44 [95 % CI 0.29 to 0.67]) [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib34">34</a>].

<p>Several meta-analyses have investigated the clinical effects and tolerance of early EN in patients with AP either within 24 h [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib41">[41]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib42">[42]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib43">[43]</a>] or 48 h [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib44">[44]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib45">[45]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib46">[46]</a>] of admission. All these meta-analyses clearly reveal that early EN is feasible, safe and well-tolerated and associated with substantial clinical benefits regarding mortality, organ failure and infectious complications for both time-points compared with delayed EN. Nevertheless, a potential bias could be that five of these meta-analysis included studies which had patients receiving PN in their control groups [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib41">[41]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib42">[42]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib43">[43]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib44">[44]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib45">[45]</a>]. One meta-analysis, compared early (within 24 h) with late EN (after 72 h), but no comparison was made between 24 and 48 h [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib43">43</a>].</p>
<p>In contrast to these data from the aforementioned meta-analyses that provided strong evidence for early EN within 24–48 h, a multicenter RCT (208 patients with predicted severe AP) found no difference in the rate of major infection or death between early EN, started within 24 h after admission, and an oral diet initiated 72 h after admission [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib43">43</a>]. A second RCT (214 patients with AP) confirmed these results [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib47">47</a>].</p>
<p>Finally, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prospective-cohort-study" title="Learn more about prospective cohort study from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">prospective cohort study</a> including 105 patients with AP concluded that the third day after hospital admission was the best cut-off time for early EN (with an area under the curve of 0.744), by reducing the risk of secondary infection and improving the nutritional status of patients, with a better tolerance [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib48">48</a>].</p>

<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>
<p>Most studies that evaluated the clinical benefits of early EN in comparison with total PN used semi-elemental formulae while the recent studies were performed with polymeric formulae. In all studies both types of formulae were proven to be feasible, safe and well-tolerated. One small RCT in 30 patients found that both formulae were safe and well-tolerated (based on a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/visual-analog-scale" title="Learn more about visual analogue scale from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">visual analogue scale</a> and number of stools per day) with some clinical benefits for semielemental diets, including length of stay (23 ± 2 <em>vs</em>. 27 ± 1 days, p = 0.006) and weight maintenance [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib49">49</a>]. On the other hand an indirect adjusted meta-analysis of Petrov et al.&nbsp;on 428 patients using PN as a reference treatment showed no differences regarding tolerance, rate of infection and mortality between both formulae [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib50">50</a>]. Finally, a second, more recent meta-analysis, including 15 trials (1376 participants), showed no evidence to support a specific enteral formula [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib51">51</a>]. Nevertheless, a subgroup of patients with severe AP may have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/malabsorption" title="Learn more about malabsorption from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">malabsorption</a> and therefore, semi-elemental diets could be of interest.</p>

<p>Three RCTs compared nasojejunal with nasogastric support route in patients with severe AP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib52">[52]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib53">[53]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib54">[54]</a>] showed no differences regarding tolerance, complications rates and mortality.

Compared with nasojejunal tubes, nasogastric tubes are much easier to place, more convenient and cheaper. Nevertheless, about 15 % of patients will experience digestive intolerance, mostly because of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/stomach-paresis" title="Learn more about delayed gastric emptying from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">delayed gastric emptying</a> and gastric outlet syndrome [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib55">55</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib56">56</a>] and in this situation, nasojejunal tube feeding is required. Furthermore, potential bias arises from the small number of patients included in the aforementioned trials and the use of different criteria to define severe AP.</p>

<p>The primary nutritional route in all patients with severe AP should be enteral, as this route has been shown to have benefits over other regimens. However, PN is indicated in patients with severe AP who do not tolerate EN or who are unable to tolerate targeted requirements, or if there exists contraindication for EN overall.

<p>An initial meta-analysis including eleven RCTs assessed the effect of antioxidants (five RCTs on glutamine and six on various other antioxidants) on the outcome of patients with AP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib60">60</a>]. Among patients with AP, antioxidant therapy resulted in a borderline significant reduction in hospital stay, a significant decrease in complication rate and a non-significant decrease in mortality rate. Nevertheless, these results were mostly attributed to the effect of glutamine. Recently, a Cochrane Review assessed the effects of different pharmacological interventions including antioxidants in patients with AP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib61">61</a>]. Very low-quality evidence suggested that none of the pharmacological treatments decreased short-term mortality in patients with AP.</p>
<p>Regarding glutamine, four meta-analyses have been published. A meta-analysis of ten RCTs including 433 patients with severe AP revealed a significant decrease in the incidence of infectious complications and mortality in the patient group with glutamine-enriched nutrition [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib62">62</a>]. Another meta-analysis of twelve RCTs (including 505 patients) demonstrated a significantly reduced infection rate and mortality after glutamine supplementation in patients with AP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib63">63</a>]. In the subgroup analyses, only patients who received total PN demonstrated a significant benefit in terms of study outcomes. Two recently published meta-analyses showed beneficial effects of glutamine supplementation in patients with AP in the terms of elevation of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/serum-albumin" title="Learn more about serum albumin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">serum albumin</a>concentrations, decrease in serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, and reductions in infectious complications, mortality and hospital stay [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib60">60</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib64">64</a>].

<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>
<p>Malnutrition is often a late, but important manifestation in the course of CP and depends on the intensity and duration of the underlying disease. The latency between onset of first symptoms and signs of CP, including pain and malabsorption/malnutrition is between five to ten years in alcoholic, but delayed in non-alcoholic pancreatitis [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4">4</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib85">85</a>].</p>
<p>Despite the inconsistency of the data there is an evident risk of malnutrition in patients with CP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib86">[86]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib87">[87]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib88">[88]</a>]. According to a recent study medium or higher risk for malnutrition based on Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) score of one or higher was found in 31.5 % patients [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib89">89</a>]. Similarly, 26 % underweight patients with a nutritional risk were identified in a study of outpatients with CP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib90">90</a>].</p>

<p>Tobacco is an independent risk factor for CP, and can also be a disease modifier, acting in synergy with alcohol intake, and therefore, adds to the nutritional risk factors [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib96">96</a>].</p>

<p>Studies assessing malnutrition have identified many biochemical factors that are associated with malnutrition [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib98">98</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib99">99</a>] and prevalence studies show a diverse presentation of malnutrition. Olesen et al.&nbsp;identified that 26 % of patients with CP were underweight in a cross-sectional study of 166 patients with CP [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib90">90</a>], whereas Duggan et al.&nbsp;highlighted that over half of the patients in their prospective controlled <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cohort-analysis" title="Learn more about cohort study from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">cohort study</a> (n = 128) fell into the overweight/obese category using BMI [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib91">91</a>]. However, patients had lower muscle stores and reduced functional status assessed using hand-grip strength than healthy controls. Consequently, BMI alone is not considered an adequate method of assessing nutritional status. Percentage weight loss is considered a more reliable indicator of the onset of malnutrition and is associated with an increased risk in the surgical setting [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib100">100</a>].</p>
<p>Consequently, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nutritional-assessment" title="Learn more about nutritional assessment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">nutritional assessment</a> should allow for detection of simple malnutrition, sarcopenia and micronutrient deficiencies in addition to identifying symptoms that may predispose patients to worsening malnutrition.</p>

<p>There are very little data to suggest the optimal dietary management for patients with CP. Historically, patients were encouraged to have a low-fat diet, and studies in the Netherlands suggest 48–58 % of patients still restrict <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fat-intake" title="Learn more about dietary fat from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">dietary fat</a> [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib95">95</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib111">111</a>]. International guidelines are consistent in their recommendation that patients should have a balanced diet and avoid fat restriction [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib4">4</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib162">[162]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib163">[163]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib164">[164]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib165">[165]</a>].

<p>Very few studies have investigated the benefit of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in patients with CP.

<p>There are no RCTs investigating the relative efficacy of different formulae (e.g.&nbsp;standard or peptide-based with medium chain triglycerides (MCT)). However, in the presence of PEI, enteral formulae consisting of pre-digested products and a mixture of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/long-chain-fatty-acid" title="Learn more about long chain fatty acids from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">long chain fatty acids</a> and MCT would seem, theoretically, to have potential advantage. MCTs are less dependent on lipase activity for their absorption [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib171">171</a>]. A reduction in oral fat intake or the replacement of dietary fat with MCT risks a reduction in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/caloric-intake" title="Learn more about energy intake from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages">energy intake</a> and, therefore, a negative energy balance. MCTs have an unpleasant taste and are associated with adverse effects like cramps, nausea, and diarrhea. Up to now, studies have not shown any clear benefit of MCTs over standard long-chain triglycerides when used in combination with enzyme supplementation [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib171">171</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561423004594#bib172">172</a>].

Dietary counselling achieved equal results compared with the use of a commercial supplement enriched with MCTs. Both groups also received enzyme supplementation and so it is not possible to explain the additional gain from dietary MCTs over enzyme supplementation.</p>
